# Non-Linear & Chaotic Systems Analysis Tools

Tools for analyzing chaotic systems without closed solutions. Implementations of Runge-Kutta numerical integration of systems of differential equations, calculator of Lyapunov exponent (measure of deterministic chaos), and functions to perform analytical methods including bifurcation plots, Poincare interpolation, trajectory embeddings.

The [embedding-data] folder contains data for the [trajectory-embedding.pyhttps://github.com/dreamchef/chaotic-systems-analysis-tools/blob/main/trajectory-embedding.py]()) script.
